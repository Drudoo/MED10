# Installation
The appliation is written for Android tablets and tested on the Nexus 7 (2013) and the Nexus 9. 
The application does not require any specific libraries or additional support from outside of Unity.
Ever scene in the Scenes folder except for ``Game_fred`` should be added to the build settings. 

## Bugs

- UniqueID is the current date, so working on a quiz at mightnight can *potentially* cause problems.
- Enter game name is not native to android. Fix later.
- Enemies walk between obstacles and not between waypoints.
- You can dismiss questions on android. 

## Build wirelessly to Android (Mac)

- Install ``adb``:


	brew install android-platform-tools


Plug in device:

    adb tcpip 5555

Unplug device

    adb connect deviceIP

Build and Run normally from Unity.

## Get Debug.Log() from Android (Mac)

- Using ``adb``:


	adb logcat
    
   
- Only get current app data

	db logcat | grep `adb shell ps | grep com.drudoo.med10 | cut -c10-15`
